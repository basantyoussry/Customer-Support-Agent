# Customer-Support-Agent
This **Customer Support Query Classification &amp; Response Generation Model** first classifies user queries into three categories: **Order Issue, Payment Problem, and General Inquiry** using a trained classifier. Based on the classification, it then generates a professional, natural-sounding response using LLaMA 2.
The model ensures concise, helpful, and human-like replies while avoiding chatbot-like phrasing, making it ideal for automating customer support interactions.
